# Welcome to the Tumamoc Hill Run Ranker
## This app is currently under development
## About
The TmocRanker app allows users to track and rank their walks (or runs!) on one of Tucson, Arizona's most popular trails, Tumamoc Hill, along with other members of the community. 

The user's time, date and name will be added to a publically accessible list that compares it to other users of the app.

## How to Use

Once complete, the app will be available on Android and iOS devices as well as through a traditional URL. 

The user arrives to the base of Tumamoc Hill where she will find a QR code at the trailhead. After scanning the code, a registration page is delivered. Only a name and maybe a zipcode will be asked. 

The user then taps a button to start the timer. When the user reaches the summit, another QR code awaits. Scanning this code will stop the timer and log the session's date and time and other info (if provided). The scan delivers a results and leaderboard page.
