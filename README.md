# Welcome to the Tumamoc Hill Run Ranker
## This app is currently under development
## About
The TmocRanker app allows users to compete, track and rank their walks (or runs!) along one of Tucson, Arizona's most popular trails, Tumamoc Hill. 

The user's time, date and name will be added to a publically accessible list that compares it to other users of the app.

## How to Use

The user arrives to the base of Tumamoc Hill where she will find a QR code at the trailhead. After scanning the code, a registration page is delivered. Only a name and maybe a zipcode will be asked. 
The user then taps a button to start the timer. When the user reaches the summit, another QR code awaits. 
Scanning this code will stop the timer and log the session's date and time and other info (if provided). 
The scan delivers a results and leaderboard page.
